Intel(R) Advisor can now assist with vectorization and show optimization
  report messages with your source code.
See "https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-advisor-xe" for details.


Begin optimization report for: main()

    Report from: Vector optimizations [vec]


LOOP BEGIN at test_vec.cpp(15,5)
   remark #15300: LOOP WAS VECTORIZED
LOOP END

LOOP BEGIN at test_vec.cpp(19,5)
   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
LOOP END
