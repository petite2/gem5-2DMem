    TODO: responseCommand() is referenced in src/cpu/simple/timing.cc, similar to createWrite and createRead
    TODO: createWrite has similar status than createRead, it is referenced in src/cpu/minor/lsq.cc, src/cpu/o3/lsq_unit_impl.hh, src/cpu/simple/timing.cc, src/cpu/trace/trace_cpu.cc. It is also referenced in src/mem/rubby/slicc_interface/AbstractController.cc, shouldn't be relevant.
    TODO: createRead is referenced in src/cpu/checker/cpu.cc, src/cpu/minor/lsq.cc, src/cpu/o3/lsq_unit.hh (this one should be relevant), src/cpu/simple/timing.cc, src/cpu/trace/trace_cpu.cc, but these are all in cpu, so if the information can propagate through, a hack in cache should be possible. It is also referenced in src/mem/rubby/slicc_interface/AbstractController.cc, shouldn't be relevant.
    TODO: makeReadCmd is referenced in src/cpu/simple/atomic.cc, changes may be needed, but since we shouldn't be using simple anyweay, probably ok?
    Added test file for changes in packet.hh, not enough test cases yet
    Added changes to packet.hh
Feb 23, 2017:
    Added MJL_BlkInv as an option in enum MJL_CacheBlkDir in src/mem/cache/blk.hh (Not used but may be useful later.)
Feb 16, 2017:
    Added bool MJL_isCol() in src/mem/cache/blk.hh
    Added bool MJL_isRow() in src/mem/cache/blk.hh
    Added MJL_CacheBlkDir MJL_blkDir in src/mem/cache/blk.hh
    Added enum MJL_CacheBlkDir in src/mem/cache/blk.hh
